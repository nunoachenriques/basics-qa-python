# Basics on Quality Assurance in Python

The basics towards better software with Python by means of development best
practices. A work in progress with a continuous improvement mindset.

There are some basic system-wide prerequisites such as `python`, `venv`, `pip`,
and `git`. Next, we will install `pipx` at user level and use this tool
to install `pipenv` isolated from the general environment. Finally, `pyenv`
is installed to assure that any Python version requested is available and
easily switched to (independently of the system Python, it uses a collection
of scripts).

**NOTICE:** Using UNIX shell commands in a Debian GNU/Linux Bash shell.
Adapt accordingly your Operating System.

## Content

* [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
* [Quality Assurance](#quality-assurance)
* [Wrap-up](#wrap-up)
* [License](#license)

## Prerequisites

**[Linux](docs/README-Linux.md)**

**[macOS](docs/README-macOS.md)**

**[Windows](docs/README-Windows.md)**

## Quality Assurance

**NOTICE:** Make sure you've completed the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) for
your operating system case!

**SHORTCUT:** If you've completed the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) AND
installed the environment with `pipenv install --dev` then you may jump to
[Git Hooks](#git-hooks).

### Clean and Tidy

#### `/.gitignore`

Avoid committing and pushing generated, private, local files. More exclusions
may be added at your discretion.

```shell
/**/__pycache__/
/.idea/
/build/
/dist/
/*.egg-info/
```

### Code Formatting

`isort`, `black`

```shell
pipenv install isort black --dev
```

**NOTICE:** black and isort may have conflicts, since they both enforce styles
in the code (https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/black_compatibility.html).
To ensure isort follows the same style as black, add a line in the
configuration file as showed below:

`pyproject.toml`

```toml
[tool.isort]
profile = "black"
```

```shell
pipenv run isort .
pipenv run black .
```

### Code Style Enforcement

`flake8` + `pyproject.toml` support = `flake8p`

```shell
pipenv install Flake8-pyproject --dev
```

`pyproject.toml`

```toml
[tool.flake8]
max-line-length = 120
ignore = ["E203", "E266", "E501", "W503"]
max-complexity = 18
select = ["B", "C", "E", "F", "W", "T4"]
```

```shell
pipenv run flake8p .
```

### Type Checking

`mypy`

```shell
pipenv install mypy --dev
```

`pyproject.toml`

```toml
[tool.mypy]
files = "."
ignore_missing_imports = true
```

```shell
pipenv run mypy .
```

### Security

`bandit`, `pipenv check`

```shell
pipenv install bandit[toml] --dev
```

`pyproject.toml`

```toml
[tool.bandit]
assert_used.skips = "*/tests/*"
```

```shell
pipenv run bandit -c pyproject.toml -r .
pipenv check
```

### Testing

`pytest`, `pytest-cov`

```shell
pipenv install pytest pytest-cov --dev
```

`pyproject.toml`

```toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
addopts = "--cov --cov-fail-under=100"

[tool.coverage.run]
source = ["."]

[tool.coverage.report]
show_missing = true
omit = ["*/tests/*"]
exclude_lines = [
    "pragma: no cover",
    "def __repr__",
    "raise AssertionError",
    "raise NotImplementedError",
    "if __name__ == .__main__.:"
]
```

```shell
pipenv run pytest
```

### Git Hooks

`pre-commit`

Putting it all together, i.e., automating while distinguishing Git `commit`
fast-checking requirement from the Git `push` more time-consuming possible
actions such as `pytest` (including coverage) and `pipenv check`.

```shell
pipenv install pre-commit --dev
```

`.pre-commit-config.yaml`

**NOTICE:** The `pipenv check` and the `pytest` (including coverage) are
configured to run only on Git `push`!

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:

      ### CODE FORMATTING

      - id: isort
        name: isort
        stages: [ commit ]
        language: system
        entry: pipenv run isort .
        types: [ python ]

      - id: black
        name: black
        stages: [ commit ]
        language: system
        entry: pipenv run black .
        types: [ python ]

      ### CODE STYLE ENFORCEMENT

      - id: flake8
        name: flake8
        stages: [ commit ]
        language: system
        entry: pipenv run flake8p .
        types: [ python ]

      ### TYPE CHECKING

      - id: mypy
        name: mypy
        stages: [ commit ]
        language: system
        entry: pipenv run mypy .
        types: [ python ]
        pass_filenames: false

      ### SECURITY

      - id: bandit
        name: bandit
        stages: [ commit ]
        language: system
        entry: pipenv run bandit -c pyproject.toml -r .
        types: [ python ]

      - id: check
        name: check
        stages: [ push ]
        language: system
        entry: pipenv check
        types: [ python ]

      ### TESTING

      - id: pytest
        name: pytest
        stages: [ push ]
        language: system
        entry: pipenv run pytest
        types: [ python ]
        pass_filenames: false
```

```shell
pipenv run pre-commit install -t pre-commit
pipenv run pre-commit install -t pre-push
```

It may be run without the Git `commit` hook triggering. This presents a 
useful way of testing the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` calls and also the
configuration in `pyproject.toml`:

```shell
pipenv run pre-commit run --all-files --hook-stage commit
pipenv run pre-commit run --all-files --hook-stage push
```

## Wrap-up

All the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) must be accomplished (by following
the above instructions or by means of a previous project installation).
The project files for [quality assurance](#quality-assurance) must be in place
(by means of unzipping a download from
[GitHub](https://github.com/nunoachenriques/basics-qa-python)).

```shell
pipenv install --dev
git init
pipenv run pre-commit install -t pre-commit
pipenv run pre-commit install -t pre-push
```

Later, you may add your local Git-based repository to a remote, such as,
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com).

```shell
git remote add origin <URL>
```
